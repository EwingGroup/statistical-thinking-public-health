Data Carpentryâ€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. 
This lesson was designed for researchers interested in working with public health data in R, but may be of interest to researchers in other fields as well.

This lesson provides an introduction to statistical concepts commonly used for linear modelling. It is a prerequisite for the other lessons in the statistics for public health curriculum. 
The lesson covers correlations, hypothesis testing, predictive relationships between variables, how to specify a model in R and the importance of model assumptions.
