title: "An introduction to linear regression"
objectives:
  - "Identify questions that can be addressed with a simple linear regression model."
  - "Describe the components that are involved in simple linear regression."
keypoints:
  - Simple linear regression requires one continuous dependent variable and one continuous or categorical explanatory variable. In addition, the assumptions of the model must hold.
  - The components of the model describe the values of the dependent and explanatory variables, the mean of the dependent variable at the 0-point of the explanatory variable, the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable and the difference between the expectation of the dependent variable and the observed value. 
questions:
  - What type of variables are required for simple linear regression?
  - What do each of the componenets in the equation of a simple linear regression model represent?
